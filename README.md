# Deep dive into video games through Sales and Scores
## Project Motivation
I love to play games! So, I decided to choose the game-related data to start my first data science project! I attempt to find insight regarding video games and scores through the questions below based on this dataset. The dataset contains information about more than 16,000 different console video games ranging from the 1980s to 2016.
- What platform sold best games?
- What drive sales of video games?
- Are there any differences between users and critics?

## Installations
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Shap
- Optuna
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn

## File description
- A Descriptive Jupyter Notebook
- A video games dataset

## Result
Results and discussion were published [here](https://medium.com/@beegee131242/deep-dive-into-video-games-through-sales-and-scores-f9b797ad4576). In this project, I took a look at video games sales and critic scores data.
- We found that PlayStation is the platform that sold the highest amount of exclusive games through observation on median Metacritic score.
- We then found that Metacritic score is the most importance feature to predict sales based on our model. Note that I am very exaggerating on this point, since there are much many variables that can indicate sales, such as marketing strategy, platform’s commercial performance, sequel games, and HYPE.
- Finally, we generate bootstrap replications to answer the question ask that “Are there any differences between users and critics”.
