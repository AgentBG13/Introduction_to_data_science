# Deep dive into video games through Sales andÂ Scores
## Project Motivation
I love to play games! So, I decided to choose the game-related data to start my first data science project! I attempt to find insight regarding video games and scores through the questions below based on this dataset. The dataset contains information about more than 16,000 different console video games ranging from the 1980s to 2016.
- What platform sold best games?
- What drive sales of video games?
- Are there any differences between users and critics?
